# Civil-Engineering-Case-Study
Our objective is to develop a menu-driven program which presents the user with different options for performing different functions regarding the force due to water pressure on a dam, namely\
1) determining the force on the dam at a particular point on the dam wall,\
2) the forces on dam wall for a range of water elevations (d1 to d2), or\
3) quit the program.
